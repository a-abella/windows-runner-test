# TestComplete QA Automation (post Tula)

## Objective

Create new set of TestComplete tests to validate new releases of TestComplete. 

The idea is to use TestComplete to test TestComplete :) 


## Repo content

Initially organized in 3 folders one for each of the main test types: desktop, mobile and web. Each folder contains a Project Suite with all the tests related.

The repo also includes a batch script that allows to execute launch the tests through a GitHub Action.

The GitHub action has to be launched manually specifying the Project Suite to be executed: Mobile, Web or Desktop.
